## Goals Achieved

- **Tablet (‚â§ 768px)**  
  - Columns (`.col`) expand to full width.  
  - *Lessons* and *Steps* sections display one card per row.  
  - In the *Why Us* section, the image and text are stacked vertically (image above, text below).  

- **Smartphone (‚â§ 480px)**  
  - Forced column layout with `flex-direction: column`.  
  - Every element is stacked one after another.  
  - Resized headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`) for better readability.  
  - Added extra spacing between elements.  

- **Between 769px and 1160px**  
  - Fixed the issue of a too rigid layout.  
  - Removed the horizontal scrollbar by resizing `.container` to `width: 100%` .
